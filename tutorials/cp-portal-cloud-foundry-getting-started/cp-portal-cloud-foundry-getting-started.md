### Subscribe to SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition

Before you can access SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition, you first need to subscribe to it and expose the required `Launchpad_Admin` role.

>SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition offers 2 types of standard plans. The **Applications Plan** which is used to access your applications from a site. In this case, you need to create a subscription to SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition, which you will do in this step. The 2nd plan is the **Service Plan** which is used to integrate with other services. This plan is not required for the scope of this tutorial.

1. From your trial subaccount, go to the **Service Marketplace** from the side panel and search for `SAP Build Work Zone, standard`.

    ![Search for Work Zone STD](15-search-wz-std.png)

    > If you aren't able to find the **SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition** tile, or if you can't access it, you may be using an older trial account. You can easily add it to your account via the **Entitlements** area. Click **Edit** and then **Add Service Plans**. Search for `SAP Build Work Zone`, check the standard (applications) plan, and click **Add 1 Service Plan**. Don't forget to save in the next screen.
