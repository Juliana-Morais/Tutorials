# Create a Card Component
<!-- description --> Define your first component using UI5 Web Components for React.

## You will learn
-  How to import components into your application
-  Learn about the usage of props
-  How to use event handling


## Intro
Integrate the first component into your App. You can find **all** available components in the [Storybook](https://ui5.github.io/webcomponents-react).
There you can try out the different components and also take a look at the coding and the available props.

---

### Add components to MyApp.tsx

First you need to import the components you want to use.

You can check out all available components in the [Storybook](https://ui5.github.io/webcomponents-react). Take your time to play around a little, change some `props` and take a look at the coding.

1. Start with importing a `Card` component into your `MyApp.tsx` file.

    ```TypeScript / TSX
    import { Card } from "@ui5/webcomponents-react";
    ```

2. So, you imported the `Card` component. Now it's time to use it. Replace the content of your `<div>` with a `<Card>`.

    In the [Storybook](https://ui5.github.io/webcomponents-react/v2/?path=/docs/data-display-card--docs), you can see that Cards can receive different props. For now only add some text as `children`.

    ```TypeScript / TSX
    <div>
      <Card>This is the content area of the Card</Card>
    </div>
    ```

Your webpage should now look like this.

And the file like this:

```TypeScript / TSX
import { Card } from "@ui5/webcomponents-react";

export function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>This is the content area of the Card</Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```



### Add content to the Card component

The heading area of the `Card` component is empty, this is because it didn't receive the `header` prop. The `header` prop expects another component, the `CardHeader`.

1. Import the `CardHeader`.

    ```TypeScript / TSX
    import { Card, CardHeader } from "@ui5/webcomponents-react";
    ```

2. Add the `CardHeader` component to your `Card` and give it a title by setting the `titleText` prop:

    ```TypeScript / TSX
    <div>
      <Card header={<CardHeader titleText="Card" />}>
        This is the content area of the Card
      </Card>
    </div>
    ```

3. Our template applies the SAP defined `font-family` for all texts that don't implement `font-family` themselves. (see `index.css` file)
   To enable this on a single text without using CSS, you can use the `Text` component. Let's wrap the text content of the `Card` inside the `Text` component:

    ```TypeScript / TSX
    import { Card, CardHeader, Text } from "@ui5/webcomponents-react";
    ```

    ```TypeScript / TSX
    <div>
      <Card header={<CardHeader titleText="Card" />}>
        <Text>This is the content area of the Card</Text>
      </Card>
    </div>
    ```



### Style your component

In this step, we will only apply [inline-styling](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style). 
You can also style your component using CSS ([modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)), but this and many more information regarding the styling approach of UI5 Web Components (for React) will be covered in [chapter six](ui5-webcomponents-react-styling) of the tutorial series.

The Card now spreads across the whole screen, this behavior is intended, so it takes up the whole space of its container.

1. To restrict the `width` of the `Card`, add the `style` prop.

    ```TypeScript / TSX
    <Card header={<CardHeader titleText="Card" />} style={{ width: "300px" }}>
      <Text>This is the content area of the Card</Text>
    </Card>
    ```

    ![Card02](02_card.png)

2. The content of the card is way too close to the border of the `Card`, so a `padding` is needed. You can define your own spacing, or use the standard SAP spacing variables. In this example we're using one of the global [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties) from the [theming-base-content](https://github.com/SAP/theming-base-content) repo, which are already included when using UI5 Web Components.
    
    The CSS var in question is `--sapContent_Space_S` (`1rem`) and we're going to apply it via inline-style again:
    
    ```TypeScript / TSX
     <Text style={{padding: "var(--sapContent_Space_S)"}}>
       This is the content area of the Card
     </Text>
    ```

    Hereby you get a standardized content-padding.

After this step `MyApp.tsx` should look like this:
```TypeScript / TSX
import { Card, CardHeader, Text } from "@ui5/webcomponents-react";

export function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card header={<CardHeader titleText="Card" />} style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        <Text style={{ padding: "var(--sapContent_Space_S)" }}>
          This is the content area of the Card
        </Text>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```
And your application like this:

![Card03](03_card.png)


### Event handling


1. The Card header can also be interactive, to enable this set `interactive` to `true`.

    ```TypeScript / TSX
    <Card
      header={<CardHeader titleText="Card" interactive />}
      ...
    </Card>
    ```

    _We didn't pass a value to `interactive`, because it [defaults to true](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#props-default-to-true) if the value is omitted._
    
    When you now click or focus the header, the appropriate styles are applied, so users know they can interact with it.     
   
2.  To make the header react to a click (or SPACE/ENTER press), add a function as value to the `onClick` prop.

    ```TypeScript / TSX
    <Card
      header={
        <CardHeader
          titleText="Card"
          interactive
          onClick={handleHeaderClick}
        />
      }
      ...
    </Card>
    ```

3. Now, add the callback function right in the beginning of the component (definition function):
    ```TypeScript / TSX
    export function MyApp() {
      const handleHeaderClick = () => {
        alert("Header clicked");
    };
    ...
    ```

The file should now look like this:
```TypeScript / TSX
import { Card, CardHeader, Text } from "@ui5/webcomponents-react";

export function MyApp() {
  const handleHeaderClick = () => {
    alert("Header clicked");
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <Card
        header={
          <CardHeader
            titleText="Card"
            interactive
            onClick={handleHeaderClick}
          />
        }
        style={{ width: "300px" }}
      >
        <Text style={{ padding: "var(--sapContent_Space_S)" }}>
          This is the content area of the Card
        </Text>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```
Now the header opens an alert box on click.
